                            Every occupier is required to cause a health and safety audit of the workplace at least once
                            in every period of 12 months by a health and safety adviser registered for that purpose by
                            the Director of Occupational health and safety as per Section 10 of Legal Notice No 31 of

                        <h5>Why Occupational and Health audits?</h5>
                        <p>
                            A Health and Safety Audit of workplaces and their associated operations is a way of
                            periodically checking if and how they are complying with the requirements of the
                            Occupational Safety and Health Act, 2007. It also allows comparisons to be made between the
                            areas that are performing well regarding health and safety management and those that are
                            not.
                        </p>
                        <h5>How are Occupational health and safety audits done?</h5>
                        <p>
                            The health and safety audit is carried out as per the code of practice for health and safety
                            auditing. This is done by a DOSHS approved health and safety auditor. The outcome of the
                            audit is documented and a copy of the report submitted to the Directorate of Occupational
                            Health and Safety Services as required under Sec. 13 (1) of Legal Notice No. 31 under the
                            Occupational Safety and Health Act, 2007 of the laws of Kenya.
